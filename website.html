        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Gas leaks pose a significant threat to life and property. Traditional methods for gas leak 
detection, often reliant on manual inspections, are proving to be inadequate due to factors like 
human error and time constraints. This necessitates the exploration of more advanced solutions. 
The IoT offers a promising approach for developing intelligent gas leak and temperature 
monitoring system for real time monitoring and automated responses to ensure safety and a comfortable environment</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>• Design and develop an IoT-based gas leakage detection & temperature monitoring system.</p>
        <p>• Integrate alerting mechanisms for timely notification.</p>
        <p>• Enable remote monitoring and control of the system. </p>

    <section id="Literature Survey">
        <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
        <p>
Several research studies have explored the potential of IoT in this domain. A study by Sharma 
et al. (2023) proposes an IoT-based system that utilizes gas sensors for leak detection and 
transmits data to a cloud platform for real-time monitoring. This approach enables remote 
access and facilitates the triggering of automated responses, such as alarm activation and gas 
valve shut-off. Similarly, Pandley et al. (2017) investigates the use of MQ-sensor technology 
within an IoT framework for gas leak detection and alerting. Their research highlights the 
potential for improved security in industrial settings through multi-sensor combinations. </p>
 
<p>Furthermore, Rachana et al. (2022) emphasizes the role of IoT in not only enhancing safety but 
also in streamlining processes like automatic gas booking. This highlights the multifaceted 
benefits of IoT integration. Additionally, Sharma et al. (2023) provides a comprehensive review 
of various sensor-based and non-sensor-based IoT systems for gas leak detection. This study 
underscores the importance of cost-effectiveness, scalability, and continuous improvement in 
the development of such systems. </p>
<p>While existing research has laid a strong foundation, there's significant potential for further 
development in IoT-based gas leakage and temperature monitoring systems.  Future efforts 
should focus on refining sensor technology to improve gas detection accuracy and minimize 
false alarms. Advanced data analytics can be harnessed for real-time anomaly detection and 
even predictive maintenance, identifying potential issues before they escalate. Additionally, 
seamless integration with existing building management systems can create a more holistic 
approach to safety and efficiency. Finally, establishing standardized protocols and 
communication interfaces would enable broader interoperability between different systems, 
fostering a more flexible and scalable approach to system design and implementation. By 
addressing these future directions, IoT-based gas leakage and temperature monitoring systems 
can become even more robust and widely applicable, ultimately creating a safer and more 
secure environment.</p>
